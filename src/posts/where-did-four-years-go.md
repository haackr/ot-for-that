Four years ago today, I graduated with my Master of Occupational Therapy degree, 12 Dec 2014. I sat for the NBCOT exam (aka BOARDS dun dun duuuun) on 6 Jan 2015, and started working on 14 Jan 2015. I am so glad I jumped in and started. We took our written Exit exams in November, while on our last Fieldwork II Rotation, and I just didn't stop studying. I felt most-prepared right away. I was about the 4th or 5th person in my class to take Boards, so I don't feel like I am out of the norm regarding this quick turn-around.

It's been a wild ride these past 4 years! I feel like it's gone so fast. I spent my first 3 years in a permanent job at an outpatient pediatric practice, which I absolutely LOVED. I was a mentee, a fieldwork educator, and best of all, a friend to my coworkers. I miss them dearly! I feel like I "grew up" in a supportive environment, learned about working with Speech and Language Pathologists and Physical Therapists. I had unofficial leadership roles (basically everything was unofficial), and was able to help new therapists grow, teach old therapists about how to use the computer system (ha!), and opened the world of OT to many aspiring students (6 of my 7 undergraduate Ex Phys students and volunteer/shadows have been accepted into and started OT school).

Now... It's been almost a full year of travel therapy and PRN work to fill in the gaps (yes, multiple month-long gaps). I wouldn't say that I love it, or hate it. It's been VERY frustrating to try to get contracts near my PT partner, because it means one or both of us is without a contract for a bit. But, travel has afforded us many, many wonderful opportunities to spend time with both of our families, that we would have not had otherwise. This was especially important when his grandfather passed away before Halloween. Absolutely priceless. We have also explored more of the USA than most people get to see in a lifetime (like 17 National Park Service Sites this year).

On top of those important "soft benefits" I have also enjoyed learning in different new-to-me settings, including: skilled nursing (short term rehab and long term care), a rural hospital's acute care and ICU, outpatient orthopedics, and home health. I love to learn all the things, so this year has been rewarding and challenging on that front. Because I'm in one of those weird long gaps (my PT has a contract but I don't), I hustled to put together 3 PRN jobs. Some days I am very busy, and some I'm not. I have been sewing a lot (hello Craft Therapy) and volunteering at a greenhouse run by a local non-profit. I'm blessed to be able to pursue other meaningful occupations outside of actual work as an Occupational Therapist. I think it makes me a better OT. I'm not as burned out and I have lots of time to develop cool interventions. 

Four years may not seem like a long time to be burned out, but Rehab Land is a grind. Insurance companies limit services. Productivity standards from higher ups (Directors of Rehab who are therapists but have quickly forgotten/ignore how it actually is to treat) make it so it's either impossible to have hands on your client OR you give an hour or two of "free" work to finish documentation. It's nonsense. 

It takes a lot of heart and soul to be an engaged, thoughtful, and purposeful therapist. I want to be on my A-game for my clients, every time. I can still remember and feel the visceral reaction I had when my Fieldwork Educator at my first Level II Fieldwork site admitted to just "muddling through" part of her day. Our first client was scheduled for 8:00am everyday, so I would show up around 7:40 to put my lunch away, turn on the fluidotherapy machine, turn on the paraffin bath, and check my schedule. (Remember, this is an unpaid internship, where I was, in fact, paying about $1,000/week in tuition to work for free.) Without fail, my FWE would show up at 8:00, or even later. 

After a few weeks, I asked her, sincerely, "I have to feel prepared for my day and make a plan. I like to get here early. How do you like to prepare?" 

She said, "Well, for the first one, I just muddle through."

I don't have a poker face--at all--so I'm pretty sure she knew exactly what I thought about that... But at that moment, I vowed to never just muddle through. Over these four years, I think I've held true to myself and have always put forth my best effort. Yes there are days when I'm on my B-game, days when I'm sick, days when I just have a slower reaction time. I am not perfect, by any means! But I always prepare, whether it's just reviewing a client's goals quickly, making parts for a craft, or researching diagnoses. I feel like I am almost always thinking about something related to OT treatment. 

About a year in to my first job, I commented to my boss and mentor, "I don't know. I just don't think we can turn off our OT brains."

"No, Andrea. YOU can't turn off your OT brain," he replied with a laugh.

I think there's OT for that?
