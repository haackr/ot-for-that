I have been so excited today! Okay, let's be honest, I've been excited about this for almost 2 weeks now. Today is the first day of my first OT Month as an Occupational Therapist! Woohoo!

The last few months have been a whirlwind of OT milestones! After graduating with my Master of Occupational Therapy on December 12, taking and passing the National Board for Certification of Occupational Therapy ([NBCOT](http://www.nbcot.org/public)) exam on January 6, I started my first OT job on January 15 as a licensed occupational therapist. What's the best part, other than getting to sign MOTR/L behind my name? After moving coast to coast in only a few short months, I am back in my hometown. I get to work with both kids and adults [at my new job](http://www.climbingtreetherapy.com/). And on Mondays, I get to do pool therapy all day! As of today, I've officially survived 11 weeks on the job. Our OT student Fieldwork II rotations are each 12 weeks long, so I've almost been a pediatric OT for as long as I was a pediatric OT student. Yet another milestone worth celebrating next week! Baby steps...

In April 2013, I celebrated my first OT Month. I was but a first term student, and honestly, I had no idea how occupational therapy would change my life. I certainly never would have been able to [explain it](http://www.aota.org/About-Occupational-Therapy.aspx). The picture below, taken by then-student, now-OTR Beth Bohnsack, is still used by AOTA on the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/AmericanOccupationalTherapyAssociationAOTA?fref=ts)!

Two years later, I am so glad that OT filled up my whole heart. I love what I do. I love seeing clients make functional improvements, big and small, day to day and week to week. It's been an exciting ride so far, and I am glad to be a part of it. Sometimes, it's really (really really) mentally and physically exhausting, but I think any new job would be. Luckily, my clients make me laugh every day. Kids really say (and do) the funniest things! It makes it easy to come to work when I get to laugh and play most of the day. Last week, I had a parent tell me that now she feels like she understands her daughter. Homework and reading goes faster; the bed time routine is easier. They are able to enjoy activities together instead of having them be a constant struggle. That certainly makes it all worth it for me. 

April is also Autism Awareness Month. I work with quite a few children and adults on the autism spectrum; it's so fitting that April brings attention to both Autism and OT. Tune in for more updates throughout April and check out the links embedded above!
