There seems to be an abundance social media links to opinion pieces by the names of "X Amount of Things You Wish You Knew About X" or "X Things You Must Do Before You Turn 25" or "X Amount of Reasons to Do (or Not Do) X." I know you've noticed these too, because, hey, if you're reading this, you know how to use the internet. And these things are all over the internet. But if you haven't, I'll spare you and not link to any of them.

As much as I hate myself for it, I'm not going to buck the trend. I am officially 56 days from graduating with my Masters of Occupational Therapy. That's right. FIFTY-SIX. Cue some hyperventilation. And maybe some very excited dancing by myself, especially since I found out that I passed my Exit Exam and nothing stands between me and that MOT. Now that I'm so close to finishing occupational therapy school, I feel like it's worth sharing my opinion about X Number of Things I wish I had Known When I Started OT School; let x = 5.

## 1. I wish I had known just how fast it would go.

Time is strange. The time between an 8:00am class on Monday and 12:00pm on Friday seems to drag. But the time spent playing basketball on Saturday mornings flies, and the period of time after church and tutoring on Sunday that I use to do all that homework I didn't do after basketball seems to move at warp speed. The time it takes a bagel to toast in the morning because I am absolutely starving and class starts in an hour but I have to leave right now or else I won't be early to study... that toaster makes time stand still, I swear. But the collective time between the first day of the trimester and the last day of finals, that time absolutely sprints to the finish line. It does not matter how long a four hour Modalities lab seems to drag out, finals come roaring around the corner faster than you'd like.

My school's program is condensed and accelerated. We don't get entire summers off and spring break doesn't exist. I have been home on 3 occasions, for a collective 26 days, since leaving on December 27, 2012. That's not a lot of days. That jam-packed academic calendar probably adds to the sensation of time speeding along. It would probably feel a lot slower if I spent months lying on the beach in the summer instead of mere days.

## 2. I wish I had known how to utilize my Fieldwork rotations better.

First thing, Fieldwork (FW) is occupational therapy's internship. Every OT program must have Fieldwork I (generally early on in your program) and Fieldwork II (at the end of your program, to make sure you're ready to be a therapist). FWII lasts 12 weeks, and there are two 12-week sessions (FWIIA and FWIIB). It's OT Law in OT Land. 

I had an absolute *blast* living in Fort Worth, TX, for FWIIA, with my best friend and her husband. Summer of 2014 will forever be the *best summer ever*. I have never felt so welcomed in a new place and can't even believe I was so blessed to be so completely enveloped as an honorary family member to such a big, loving family. I wouldn't change the experience one bit.

So, why do I wish I had done things differently? It's a long story. It's not the location that's my problem, it's the setting. I recognized my problem after 2nd term, but didn't correct it during 3rd term when it came time submit lists of our top 10 choices for Fieldwork sites with which my school has contracts. Part of my problem is what we were told by the faculty in charge of Fieldwork placements. "Pick what you like," they said. "You've been out on FWI, so you should have an idea."

All of my observation hours coming into school were in upper extremity rehab (with a Certified Hand Therapist) and pediatrics (school-based therapy). Hands and kids. My FWI sites 1st term were one day each in various settings: outpatient pediatrics, hands, adults with developmental disabilities, skilled nursing facility, and inpatient rehab on an orthopedic floor. An excellent mix, really. At the end of the 1st trimester, we were asked to write down which sites we liked the most. You know how most people like things that they are comfortable with?

Yeah. I'm most people.

I had the most experience with hands and kids before, and was therefore the most comfortable with those settings during 1st term. I liked what I was comfortable with. I wrote, "Pediatrics (school-based) and Upper Extremity." I simply answered the question that was asked. No foresight. No thinking. I answered the question and left.

What did I end up with 2nd term for my FWIA (4 days each)? Kids. And hands. This time I was at a private school for children with autism and then with a certified hand therapist ([CHT](http://www.htcc.org/certify) [a super big deal for those of you outside the therapy world]). Suddenly near the end of second term, it dawned on me: "All I know is hands and kids! Hands. And kids! And kids with hands! Ahhhhhh!!"

I scrambled to send a message to the Clinical Education department at school. *Please, send me to a hospital. Put me in acute care. I don't care how many lines are coming out of a patient's body. I need to learn all the things about all the OT in all the places.* Okay, okay, I didn't actually say that, but I  did think it, and emailed my professor. I wrote down "Acute Care and Inpatient" on the next form. 

I almost got everything for which I asked. FWIB (4 days each, in 2 settings) was at a ranch doing [hippotherapy](http://www.americanhippotherapyassociation.org/) (with kids...) and then on a traumatic brain injury floor in a rehab hospital. At long last, third term was shaping up for more success on the learn-all-the-things front! If I had known more about traumatic brain injury (TBI), I probably would have gotten even more out of the rotation (we didn't take the Neuro rehab class until fourth term), but I still loved it. Unfortunately, brain injury floor happened at the very very very end of third term, long after we had already turned in paperwork to pick sites for FWII, the big papa of OT hands-on learning. So I didn't have the experience yet, and did not think to pick a brain injury setting specifically.

I opted to pick by geographic locations for FWII and consider OT settings second. I like to travel and I have family and friends in a lot of places around the country. I was on the lookout for a safety network, a cool place, cheap rent, and people to do stuff with. Oh yeah, and an OT setting. I filtered the spreadsheet. North of I-40 in the winter? *No thank you. Florida made me soft.* Skilled Nursing Facility? Old people butts. Nope. I'll take Pennsylvania in the summer! *Sorry, no locations match your query.* Okay, California in the winter then! *Bingo.* Five sites in the Fort Worth area? *Sweet! I've got family and friends all over the place around there!* 

So there it was. Top picks for FWIIA: Fort Worth area with settings in acute, inpatient, peds, hands, in that order. I rounded out the list with other places I knew I had family. Top picks for FWIIB: anything in Los Angeles county with settings in school-based pediatrics (5 miles from an uncle's house, okay?), acute, brain injury, acute, inpatient, acute, acute. I was going to get into a hospital if it killed me (or work at a school if it meant free rent).

I got my top selection for FWIIA, in Fort Worth. The only problem with my top selection of an acute setting in Fort Worth? The data was entered incorrectly. It wasn't a hospital at all. It's an outpatient orthopedic setting. OT specialty in upper extremity. Hands. But Fort Worth was mine for the taking.

"Are you sure you want hand therapy? You asked for acute."

"No no. Sure. Uh... Yeah, I love hands! I'm very comfortable with hands."  

*Of course you are, you idiot; that's all you know! Shut up, brain! I'm going to Fort Worth and you can't stop me!*

Best. Summer. Ever. And now I have a job offer in upper extremity therapy. I like it. I'm good at it. And you can't beat a job offer that will allow you to go home, to do something you like.

As for FWIIB, following a series of unfortunate snafus (the site said they'd take a student, and then decided against it), I lost my top placement (5 miles from my uncle's house) and all the other SoCal spots on my list were taken by other students. My school has a campus in San Marcos, CA, so the along with other top OT programs in LA, the SoCal area is a bit inundated. Fortunately, by some stroke of luck, a spot opened up at a site in Encinitas, CA, a mere 15 miles from the San Marcos campus of my school. I did a phone interview, and got the spot!

It's been a crazy 5 weeks so far in this out-patient pediatric setting (*kids!*), but I really like it. It's challenging in so many ways (which is a post in its own right, still in the editing process), but there's also something about spending all day with kids that just melts my heart, even when it wants to break.

Hands and kids. I guess it was meant to be. 

*But, Andrea, it's working out. Why do you wish you'd done it differently?* You're right. It's fine. It's great. Fort Worth was amazing. Now, I'm living 5 miles from the San Marcos campus. I get to use the gym and library, I've made friends at the school, I see breakthroughs every day with the kiddos at FW, I eat lunch outside in the grass. It's pretty awesome. I'm learning so much and enjoying most days. I am happy. But, if I could have seen a bigger variety of settings, like ICU and inpatient and mental health, I think I would have learned more. Well, no, not more. I'm learning a whole lot now. But I would have learned different things. The same number of things, but in different areas, adding to my breadth of OT knowledge. And perhaps I would have felt better about that. Maybe I would have found a new calling in OT. Now, I'll never know. Sure, sure, I can get a job as a new grad in those settings if I want, but I'm sure it would be an easier transition to the working world if I had FW experience in the area.

Long story longer... I guess what I'm really saying is that I've learned so much and wouldn't change anything that has happened, but I could've at least tried to vary my FWI rotations better.

So, if you're early on in your OT schooling, don't do what I did. Don't answer the question "What setting do you like the best?" with the comfortable truth. Ask yourself a different question instead: "What haven't I seen yet? Where would I like to know more about the role of OT?" Answer that question honestly, at least for FWI, and open up your OT world. I'm sure you won't regret it. 

## 3. I wish I had known to how to enjoy it more.

Don't live somewhere for 18 months and only know the inside of your school. Okay, I wasn't that extreme. But when the security guard at school knows you by name and jokes that you must secretly be sleeping in the locker room, you have a problem. (Seriously, though, there are much more comfortable places to sleep at school. Hello, the whole place is full of treatment tables and sheets and pillows!)  I had a terrible time concentrating at home. The house was loud and full of other people (I lived for free with my aunt and uncle, so I'll take it), so I just stayed at school. All. Day. I packed a lunch and a dinner every day and had two lockers full of books (I tutored a lot), study snacks, and extra clothes for whatever dress code requirement might pop up. I lived 2.5 miles from the beach, but I can count on 2 hands the number of times I actually got down to the water in 18 months. 

It wasn't until fourth term (after I'd lived in St. Aug for a year) that the impending doom of moving far away to go to Fieldwork (remember how my priority was to experience something new?) finally hit me. I realized there was so much more to do! I frantically ran my first timed 5k (read about it!), went paddle boarding with my aunt, savored the too-short drives to and from church with my Grandma, and ate as much frozen yogurt as I could with my friends at our [favorite local froyo shop](http://augustine.com/restaurant/coco-mango-frozen-yogurt).

I like St. Augustine a lot. I definitely didn't just stay at home or school all the time. I mean, I went to the Lighthouse 3 times, so that counts for something, right? But I probably should have spent more time playing volleyball at the pier (there was a steep decline after second term), going to the farmers market, learning more about the history of the Ancient City, dancing more with the older people at the ballroom association, and going to a few more [Reggae Sunday](http://conch-house.com/lounge/reggae-sunday/) bashes (no, I'm kidding, one time was enough for me).  

## 4. I wish I had slept just a little bit more. 

It wasn't like I ran on 3 hours of sleep a night. Most nights I got 6 hours. But honestly, whatever you're pulling yet another all-nighter to finish, it's just not worth it. Your brain needs rest to learn whatever it is you're frantically trying shove in it instead of actually giving it a break. Don't believe me? [Science](http://www.ted.com/talks/arianna_huffington_how_to_succeed_get_more_sleep). [Science](http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_iliff_one_more_reason_to_get_a_good_night_s_sleep?language=en). [More science](http://www.ted.com/talks/russell_foster_why_do_we_sleep). (If you aren't clicking on the links, you're missing out--it's science talks in video form. You don't have to read anything.)

I mean let's get real, who wants to be around a sleep deprived grad student revved up on coffee and strung out on adrenaline and cortisol? *Not me, that's who.* It's not pretty. Really not pretty. Emotionally, physically, all around, I am a really ugly person when I'm tired (or hungry). So don't be that person. Unless you are my partner in crime, who is gorgeous inside and out, no matter how little sleep she gets, you just need to go to bed. (Seriously, so irritating. I want to be more like her!)

Close the laptop. Bookmark that page. Set an alarm. Rest your head. Your brain, body, and everyone around you will thank you.

## 5. I wish I known just how powerful that perfect study buddy and best friend could be.

Find that one person. And never let go. 

I'm talking about that partner in crime I mentioned in #4. Find the person that challenges you when you study to think outside the box. The one that will get you up early or be honest with you and tell you to just go to bed if it's too late and you aren't making sense anymore. The one that will let you take a shower at her place after basketball because, no, she does not want to smell you either, but you still need to study together. Find the person that has the same high standards for turning in work and won't let good be good enough. Find the one that, like you, will only take an A+ for an answer, not for the A+, but for the intrinsic satisfaction of knowing that you turned in your best work.

Never let go of that person. Because group work sucks without her, and it's better to know you've got someone you can count on. I'm lucky I found her early on (I sat down next to her at orientation; can't get much earlier than that!) and I'll never make the mistake of trying to complete group work or study without her ever again. Find that one person. I'm serious. One. When it comes to studying or being productive, if you have any more than one other person, you just have a party.

I obviously didn't make a mistake in this area. I got really lucky to find out that my best study buddy is now also my best friend. I just wish I hadn't underestimated the importance of never letting her get away from my group for projects!

Fifty-six days from graduation, **I don't regreI don't regret any of it.** All the things I've learned or wished that I had done differently have shaped me and my outlook on a new and exciting career as a healthcare practitioner. It's important to me that I think them out, write them down, and share them now. Don't be like me. Go to the beach and go out on dates. Experience all the practice settings you can. OT Land is a vast and wonderful place. 

If you are just starting out on the journey of OT school, I hope you find this helpful, or at the very least, amusing. If you're well on your way through OT school, do me a favor and take a night off from studying and go to one new restaurant or historical landmark, wherever it is that you live. And if you're not in either of these 2 camps, congratulations for reading this whole thing. You deserve a sticker!

Don't worry. I have a bunch of stickers. You know, it's because I work with kids (and their hands).
