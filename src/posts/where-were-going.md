I posted a few weeks ago about how alone travel therapy would have been easier. But sticking together (we are a married OT and PT team) and being near family is far more important to us than working near a beach or 52 weeks a year. We found in 2018 that is was incredibly difficult to find travel contracts near each other in states where we want to be (with family). We realize we have been far too picky on location for 2018 and it has cost us at least 10 weeks of work, each. We have a revised plan for year two (2019) of travel therapy:

Say, "yes."

Okay, so it's actually really hard to plan out much more than a contract and a half in advance, especially as two providers traveling together. We are pretty flexible about setting (see previous post about 5 settings we've been in this year). Our travel company (a small team of recruiters who have been "in the biz" for 15 years) is set in Maryland. They are very, very linked in to the DMV (Metro DC Maryland Virginia) area, so for 2019, we're saying, "yes" to Virginia.

We're finishing out travel extensions in my partner's homestate, which will take us through the spring. It's a little complicated right now because I couldn't find any travel OT positions, so I put together 3 PRN OT jobs. One just finished, so I'm down to two (and much less commute/away from the base time). Then our plan is to head to VA. He already has his VA PT license, and I'll get my VA OT license soon.

After that, who knows? It's been hard to plan around contracts, because sometimes they end suddenly, but I think my sticking to the area that our company knows, we'll have a good solid amount of work for us in 2019.
