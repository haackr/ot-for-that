Today, one of my 5th grade kiddos built an obstacle course in the gym. As part of the course, he wanted to shoot Minecraft zombies (plastic cups we use as targets) with the Nerf dart crossbow. We reviewed the four safety rules for using the crossbow, verbally along with demonstration. He needed some prompting to recall the rules (after about 3 minutes, I asked him our range rules). His mom, who is in the Air Force, asked in a different way, "What are our 3 rules for gun safety?"

He remembered the first two rules with a little bit of cueing. For the third one, mom prompted with, "Never aim at anything..." 

"...That is expensive," he replied.

"No. That you wouldn't want dead," she said. "Never point a gun at anything you wouldn't want dead."

Gun safety is serious business, even if it's "just" Nerf. My client's response was hilarious. Kids say the funniest stuff! And it taught me that we have to teach things in different ways, be open to the wording or routines of the families with whom we work. Both of this client's parents are in the military, have extensive training with weapons, and have obviously done a great deal of teaching their son the safety rules in a way that (hopefully) he remembers. We were able to take some time at the end of his obstacle course, and he wrote down the range rules, with little to no prompting. Multi-modal learning!

This particular exercise was important for executive function.

Executive function is, very simply, how our brains work in order to help us reach a goal. This command center can be thought of as behavioral and emotional control: self-regulation, inhibition of impulses, shift or transition. It also includes mental control or metacognition: monitoring one's work, organizing materials, planning steps of a task, working memory (holding information in memory so you know what to do), and initiation or beginning a task once you have made a plan or making a plan when you have been given instructions.

The delayed recall of the range safety rules was a little test of his working memory. When he couldn't remember, he problem-solved through some things he knew his mom may be upset about. Hearing, seeing, practicing, and writing down the rules helped him remember.

Think about all the ways you organize your life and the tasks you want to accomplish. It could be basic like putting on a shirt, or as complicated as shopping for, preparing, cooking, and presenting a 5-course meal. Can you remember everything you need to do? Are you able to double-check, or monitor for errors along the way? What if you could not do all of that? What if you had "holes" in your execution of goal-directed action?

There's OT for that.
