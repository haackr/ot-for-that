*Note: this a throwback from my personal blog, but I thought that updating it and posting it here would be relevent.*

Among my group of close friends in the lovely world of occupational therapy school, the phrase, "There's OT for that," must be the thing we say the most often. We say it as a joke. We say it in complete seriousness. We say it to tease each other when someone (usually me) bumps into a table. And sometimes we say it to prove a point: OT is a vast and amazing health field and it never ceases to amaze me. There is OT for almost everything.


## What OT is For 
>In the morning when you wake up
And you can't quite figure out
How to pour coffee in your cup
And your shirt's all turned about...
Or perhaps you can't navigate
Your daily route to school.
You're not sure of today’s date
And you need help using a tool...
Whether it’s here or there,
It's important to do all the things
About which you really care.
(Think of all the joy it brings!)
An injury can really throw you for a loop
And make it incredibly hard
To get froyo with the group
Or even mail out a birthday card.
It's a good thing, then, that help isn't far.
You just need to have a little chat
With a therapy rising star,
Who will say, "There's OT for that!"


Please excuse the preposition at the end of the title. Let's just call it poetic license. :) My mom and my middle school English teacher are probably dying right now, but oh well.

I wrote this over Thanksgiving break 2013 to give to my OT friends for Christmas 2013. Almost a year later, it makes me laugh. I printed out the poem, glued it to the back of patterned construction paper, laminated it, cut a hole in the top, and wrote "Therapy in Progress" on the front, to have as a door knob hanging sign (like at hotels). I thought it was a cute, clever, and cheap gift! What can I say, OTs are probably some of the most creative people I know!

Of course, there's even more that OT can help so many people with, whether it's in an inpatient hospital setting, an outpatient orthopedic clinic, a school, a work site that needs ergonomic analysis, children's museums, prisons, support groups, adaptive sports, home health, a park, driving tests, and so much more...
