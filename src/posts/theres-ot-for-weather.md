When we began our travel therapy adventure in January 2018, we naively thought we'd be able to control the weather, or at least, where we got contracts. We thought we'd be able follow the sun and warmth... Alone, it would have been easy. But sticking together (we are a married OT and PT team) and being near family is more important to us than working near a beach. It has been difficult to find travel contracts near each other in states where we want to be (near family). We realize we have been far too picky on location this year and it has cost us at least 10 weeks of work, each. We have a revised plan for year two (2019) of travel therapy.

But, back to the weather.

It's beginning to snow a bit up here in New England. We got 10 inches of snow a week before Thanksgiving. It took us an hour to get to our coworkers' house after our hospital shift, when it usually takes about 20 minutes. Carpooling through rural Connecticut with my PT partner is beginning to look more and more like a winter wonderland. ❄️ 

Never fear. There's OT for weather. Or, at least, for dressing for it. 

Choosing seasonally- and weather-appropriate clothing is an important facet of dressing and self care. Getting dressed, an activity of daily living, is often overlooked until one has an injury, illness, or exacerbation of disease process (physical or mental) that makes dressing difficult. With Occupational Therapy, though, it is not impossible.

Of course, there are the physical components such as fine motor (zipping or buttoning, pinch strength to pull up pants), gross motor (coordinating arms and legs through the correct holes), and balance. There are also perceptual and executive functioning components. Sequencing is important. You don't want your underwear on the outside! (I'm talking to you Quailman. I'm a 90s kid who grew up watching Doug Funny on Nickelodeon, so this is extra great. Gotta love cartoons and OT!)

Visual perceptual deficits may make it hard to discern the front of a garment from the back. Strategies and compensations for planning what to wear may be as simple as a phone reminder to check the weather. Perhaps, help can include visual supports such as weather symbols matched with pictures of clothing:

☀️ = 🎽👓👒    Sunny = tank top, sunglasses, and sunhat 

⛈️ = ☂️🧥👢         Rainy = umbrella, raincoat, and boots.

An Occupational Therapist will be able to assess each person's situation and make client-centered individualized recommendations.

The sky is the limit!
