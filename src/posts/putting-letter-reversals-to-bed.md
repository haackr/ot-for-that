Inspired by a [recent AOTA Facebok post](https://www.facebook.com/AmericanOccupationalTherapyAssociationAOTA/photos/a.10150404700403017.357026.24139318016/10152816582933017/?type=1&fref=nf), I thought I'd share one thing I did today. If you click the link above, you can see what other occupational therapists, occupational therapy assistants, and OT/OTA students are doing, too. This was with my last kiddo of the day, so it's fresh in my mind. I've done a lot of cool stuff every day for the last 14 weeks (I can hardly believe I started my 15th week of work today!), but this really put a smile on my face. My heart was definitely smiling, too. OT really does fill up my whole heart!

AOTA asks us to make it concrete! I am an OT, and proud of what I do everyday!
Today I... helped a 2nd grader with visual perceptual deficits (which make it hard for him to read and write) remember which way the lowercase 'b' and 'd' go by making a 'bed' with my hands. An OT professor taught my class this trick and I haven't forgotten!

Follow along, now. Make two thumbs up. Put your knuckles together so you can see your fingers and your thumbs face each other. Your left hand is the 'b' and headboard. Your right hand is the 'd' and footboard. My kiddo thought it was funny and we drew a pillow and blanket on top of the word 'bed.' I drew some shoes under it, too (because that's often where I kick those off).

Then, I got out my handy dandy Scholastic Rhyming Dictionary that I bought in 5th grade--yes, I still have it!. Together, we created a limerick about a dragon and my kiddo practiced writing the rhyming words when we were done. I gave him the prompt, "There once was a..." and he came up with the idea of a dragon and the name Flames (I suggested the name Pete haha). We flipped to the rhymes-with-aim entry, and away our imaginations went!

>There once was a dragon named Flames.\
"Kill him!" the King exclaims!\
So Flames called his brother,\
Father, sister, and mother,\
And they burned down the castle in flames.\

Next week I'll have him write the whole poem, illustrate it, and take it home to show his family. My mind is already full-speed-ahead on a whole dragon-themed "curriculum" we can do for the next couple of weeks to hit a bunch of areas in which he needs help. Dragon mazes... dragon bingo... castle target practice... matching dragon pictures... Among other things, I'm hoping to make writing more fun for him and eliminate those letter reversals! 

P.S. His mom wanted to know what else she could do at home with him. ***Parent and client education is key!*** More activities for this kid to do to work on his visual perception and visual motor integration (fine motor hand-eye coordination) include: Where's Waldo?, spot the differences, hidden pictures, word searches, bingo, mazes, building Lego models from picture instructions, playing Simon (the electronic game with 4 colored lights/buttons), connect the dots, etc. There's a lot we can do and I am so happy I get to work with great kids with great parents!
