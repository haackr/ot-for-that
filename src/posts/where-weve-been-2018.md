I had been chronicling our travels via our personal social media accounts, but the more and more we go, the more people we meet, the more therapists that have reached out to me about my thoughts on travel therapy, I figured I should fire up the ol' blog again. (If you go back you can see that after grad school, and my first few months of work, I basically just stopped posting. Oops! Real life.)

On January 6, 2018, we left our home base and embarked on what has been an enriching, though sometimes frustrating, travel therapy adventure. The idea is simple: We take temporary work assignments away from home. The assignments arise because facilities need therapists to cover for a variety of reasons: maternity leave, family medical leave, an influx of patients (a season of high census), a therapist quits unexpectedly, or a facility wants to test-drive having another therapist without going through the HR hassle. In short, these assignments pay a premium, due to the nature of being in a pinch, and some of that pay is tax-free, because it is a housing stipend. We have cut our expenses considerably, but you know what is the best way to pay off hefty grad school loans aggressively? Make more money. Many of our friends have done and still do travel therapy. It sounded like a good fit for us, as hard as it was to leave our comfortable and amazing pediatrics clinic (I had been there for 3 years). Some of our travel assignments this year have been as short as 2 weeks and others as long as 18 weeks. When we began our travel therapy adventure in January 2018, we naively thought we'd be able to control the weather, or at least, where we got contracts. We thought we'd be able follow the sun and warmth...

Alone, it would have been easy. But sticking together (we are a married OT and PT team) and being near family is far more important to us than working near a beach. It has been difficult to find travel contracts near each other in states where we want to be (with family). We realize we have been far too picky on location this year and it has cost us at least 10 weeks of work, each. We have a revised plan for year two (2019) of travel therapy, which I'll flesh out in an upcoming post.

So, a good and cool thing about “Therapy Land” is that there are many realms in which to work. We were placed in many new-to-us settings this year, which means we are learning so much! So far, we have worked in the following settings (collectively):
Skilled nursing facilities (where people go if they’re well enough to leave the hospital but too sick/weak to go home)
Inpatient Intensive Care Unit and Acute Care (when people get admitted to the hospital)
Outpatient orthopedic (people are well enough to drive to a clinic)
Outpatient pediatric clinic (similar to my pre-travel permanent position) 
Home health (seeing patients in their homes, usually after they are discharged from the hospital or skilled nursing).
Working as an OT, I have done everything on this list, albeit, not all of it is as a "traveler" (that is another post, upcoming). My PT partner has not done home health or much outpatient pediatrics since we left our wonderful permanent pediatrics jobs at the end of 2017.  He gets a few pediatric orthopedic patients in the hospital clinic, but no real developmental peds like before. That's five (5!) different settings as an OT, and three (3) different settings for PT. Not only is that a lot of different electronic health records/documentation systems to learn, but it's a lot of "code-switching." It keeps me on my feet, and I think, has made me a better clinician.


We have had assignments in California and Connecticut. How'd we get from one coast to the other? Driving, of course. This is an adventure! It’s been a very big year for exploring the Grand Ol’ USA!  I can post details of our route and what we did, if anyone is interested (leave a comment). There are lots of traveling therapists out there. If you want to know good places to explore, let me know.
