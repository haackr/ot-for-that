Have you ever just taken a minute to think about everything that you do every day? I'm not talking about keeping a to do list and checking it all off. I'm talking about really taking a step back and marveling at what you are capable of.

Because you are amazing.

There is no limit to the sense of wonder I feel every single day that I work with the kids and adults in my role as an occupational therapist. I mean the specific kids (and some of the adults) are awesome, for sure, and they light up my world, but I am amazed by human beings, in general. 

It's the same feeling I got in my anatomy class, learning the embryology units. Let me tell you, the development of the human baby in utero is pretty dang amazing. Let's just consider the heart briefly, for example. You would not even believe the number of things that have to be just right, the number of cells that have to divide at exactly the right moment in time, the holes that have to close, the valves that have to open. Whole chambers of the heart move around, for crying out loud! Honestly, it's a miracle that more of us aren't born with congenital heart malformations.

The same is true with other development. It is amazing to me that I can even do anything everyday, much less have the capacity to do it well. This is because I watch people struggle everyday to do the simple things I took for granted mere hours earlier as I got dressed and tied my shoes. Or as I correctly sequenced a 5 step meal for breakfast. And then ate it and cleaned up. I can do all of these very complicated things, and more, by myself, independently. I am an autonomous being. 

I often take being autonomous for granted, because it's easy for me to do the things I need to do, do them well, and do them quickly. I rarely think about how or why I do them as I'm doing the tasks. That is, until I get to work and I help anywhere from 4 to 12 children and/or adults per day take off and put on (doff and don, respectively) their shoes. Yes, we do other things, but especially in pediatrics, there's a lot of shoes off and on in order to keep mats clean. In skilled nursing and hospitals, I have to make sure clients at least have non-slip socks on before we even stand up from the bed or chair, so there's a good chance we'll be doing lower body dressing to start the session. In the last (almost) 4 years as an OT, I have probably watched (and helped as necessary, of course--I'm not an evil person who loves to watch others struggle) more shoes and socks get taken off and put back on than most people do in a whole lifetime.

*I think about shoes a lot and what it takes to wear them.*

Think about putting on and taking off your shoes. What are your fingers doing? Is there a position that makes it easier? Do you have proximal stability to allow that distal mobility (if you can't hold your trunk and head up and are relying on your hands to stabilize yourself, how in the world would you ever be able to use your hands to tie your shoes)? Can you feel your laces? Does the color of the laces matter or help you see them better? In OT Land, we call this in-depth thought "activity analysis."

Shoes are complicated. Socks are worse. They often are inside out and even after being turned right side out, never seem to have the heel where it should be. Elastic is hard for small and/or weak hands to stretch open, much less keep open AND pull over the toes. Then add in a broken hip or a knee replacement, a common diagnosis for my older clients. Can they even reach their feet? Can they learn to use a sock aide? Most of my clients wear shoes with velcro straps, not laces. Why? Mostly because a lot of these kids are too young for it to be developmentally appropriate for them to tie shoes anyway. And for those that are old enough, tying laces is hard. It is complicated to sequence. It has lots of steps. It requires precise manipulation of all ten digits. It requires accurate grading of force to hold on to the laces (not letting them slip out of little pincers). For older adults, arthritis and diminished touch sensation make it hard to even hold or feel the laces. You can see the trouble, right? 

I remember being in kindergarten and learning to tie my shoes. I worked on it at home with my parents and at school with my teacher. I remember getting stuck one morning and needing help. My dad was frustrated. I had a school bus to catch.

"You were able to do this yesterday!" he sighed.

I didn't know why I couldn't do it again; I was 5. I just couldn't.

But now I know why, because I am an OT, working to be an expert in development, learning, and activity analysis. In motor learning terms, my 5 year old self was moving into the associative stage. I knew "what to do" (cognitive stage, in which skill acquisition occurs), but I didn't know "how to do" (associated stage, in which skill retention occurs). Very soon, though, with more guidance and practice, I was in the autonomous stage, in which skill transfer occurs. I knew "how to succeed" at shoe tying and am able to transfer that skill to many things: different shoes, other people's shoes, bows on vases of flowers at my cousin's wedding, ribbons on the back of my hair without even looking! It's amazing, really.

*Okay, we get it. Shoes are hard to tie, and you're a tying master now.*

Yes, but that's not the point. The point is, you've thought about how easy it is to tie your own shoes. Go deeper. Think about how you are able to put on socks, select a pair of shoes that is appropriate for the day or activity (would you wear flip flops in winter? high heels to play volleyball?), put them on, straighten the tongue, and then secure them to your feet.  

It's complicated, right?

So think of little 5 year-old me, a typically developing kid, being unreliably able to tie my shoes... Then magnify that by a bazillion! That is how hard it is for the atypically developing kids I work with to tie their shoes. But not just shoes. Everything. Get dressed. Feed themselves. Write. Walk without stumbling. Sit up without falling out of the chair. Play a game with other people. Read. The list goes on and on. For kids and people who haven't learned these skills, we call this therapy habilitation. Sure, not every kid I see has every problem. All kids have strengths! Some kids only have some difficulties in very limited areas; others have severe difficulties in many areas. Every kid is different. 

Now think about how frustrating all of that would be to relearn, if you knew you could do it at one point in your life... That's how it is for some of the adults with whom I work. We're rehabiliating. It's good to keep this in mind, and be able to meet clients where they are. Accept their frustration, fear, anger... and validate it. To say, yes, it does suck. I know this is hard. I know it's embarrassing. I know it will not get easier as quickly as you want. I'm not here to do it for you, but I'm here to help you do it for yourself, even if it takes time.

I tell them, "There is OT for this."
