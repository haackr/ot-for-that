During 2nd term, when we took Biomechanics and got to the Dreadful Gait Test, Dr. Gorniak said that we'd never look at anyone's walk the same way. Well, thanks, OT school, I don't look at anyone doing anything the same anymore ever. 

## My brain won't even relax when I watch TV (uh--Netflix) anymore.

I diagnosed a kid with [Sensory Processing Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_processing_disorder#Autistic_spectrum_disorders_and_difficulties_of_sensory_processing) in a TV show I was watching on Netflix. I started watching "Parenthood" since I passed my Written Exit Exam, and my new roomie recommended it. You know, there's nothing like delaying studying for National Boards by actually putting OT into "relaxing." In the very first episode, an 8 y/o boy, Max, is cutting a half circle out of a folded piece of paper, but at the end of the cut, gets frustrated and just rips the paper at the end, instead of opening and closing the scissors one more time. *Come on, kiddo! One more snip. This is a scissor skill that you should have mastered at least 2 years ago, if not 3!* Yeah, I was cheering on a fictional character / shouting developmental milestones at my computer.

Max attempted it three times before getting frustrated and subsequently being antagonized by another kid in the class. From the very first time I saw Max rip the paper with the scissors instead of finishing cutting, I said to myself, "That's a kid that needs OT." As the scene went on, and the frustration built, I kept thinking, "Where the heck is his teacher? Where is an OT? Please tell me this show has an OT." When he attacked the kid that teased him, I thought, "Oh my... gosh... There is OT for this." Kids can be really mean. They can be even meaner towards things they don't understand or perceive as strange.

Spoiler alert: It turns out that they get him evaluated by a child psychologist and he is diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome in the next episode. (For many kids with Autism Spectrum Disorder ["new" DSM 5 notation], Sensory Processing Disorders, or Sensory Integrative Dysfunction, are part of the overall picture.) I hate being right. Dang you, OT school, you ruined Netflixing!

## Even changing into a swim suit to relax on the beach has been compromised.

All I can think about when I turn my shirt back right-side-out when I'm changing is how Present Andrea is giving Future Andrea set-up assistance for upper body dressing. But that it still means Future Andrea is independent in upper body dressing. *Who thinks stuff like this?!* An OT student 43 days from graduation, that's who. 

## OT makes me force myself to pretend to enjoy folding laundry.

Laundry is, by far, my least favorite Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL). So to get through it, I tell myself, "Think of all the people who would kill to be able to fold laundry as easily and as pain free as you do! Think about that little old lady with carpal tunnel syndrome! That man with only one arm! Get it together, woman, it's just one terrible IADL. Think about how easy it is for you to do and just do it!" I tell myself to suck it up because there are so many people out there who can't fold their laundry as easily or efficiently as I do, but they still do it. Yet, I never tell myself to suck it up and fold my laundry because there are people in the world *who don't even have laundry* and how I should be blessed to have any clothes at all. I am a terrible person. 

## I stop what I'm doing and identify gait pattern whenever I see someone using a cane/walker/crutches.  

Three point? Four point? What is the weight-bearing status? Non-weight-bearing? Toe-touch? Weight-bearing as tolerated? Are those axillary (armpit) crutches even at the right height? No, dang it, do not hang on your crutches by your armpits. Stop that! In addition, you would be amazed by the number of older people that I see basically carrying their assistive devices. Security blanket? *Oh no, this is a security cane.*

## I can't even visit people's homes anymore.

You see that floor rug there? Fall hazard. The stairs that are all carpeted in white and you can't really tell where each step is in the sea of white carpet? Fall hazard. The fact that you have a front step period? Fall hazard. Not enough lighting? Fall hazard / straining your eyeballs.  Cables and cords every which way? Fall hazard / potential fire hazard. The world will never be safe enough!

## I analyze people's handwriting for pen(cil) grasp, force, fluidity, hyperextension/flexion of thumb/finger joints. 

I even chastise *myself* for slipping into a lazy lateral grasp when my hand gets tired. Do you think you can quickly sign your name on some list without getting caught? Nope! It doesn't even matter how long you had that writing implement in your hand. I definitely noted if you were using a dynamic tripod or a static tripod or a dynamic quadrapod or a static quadrapod or a lateral grip or something even stranger and if you have any thumb opposition and how many fingers are curled under into your palm. *I saw it!* I also made note of just how much that last joint of your index and/or middle fingers are bent backwards (hyperextended) and I shuddered inside. If your knuckles turn white when you write, you are doing it wrong. I built-up so many pens with Coban this summer at my hand therapy fieldwork, it's not even funny. Bigger grip? Less range of motion and force needed to hold the pen(cil). Don't want to go out and buy pencil grips. Duct tape saves the day! (I just used fancy Coban because it was readily available and comfortably spongy.)

## Many of my friends have kids and I can't just say, "Ooooooh she's soooooo cute!" 

"Awwwww he's so developmentally appropriate. You see how he's pointing and making eye contact to communicate? Oooooooh that's just so awesomely developmentally appropriate." Yeah, that actually happened last weekend when I met my cousins' kids for the first time. I work with kids everyday at Fieldwork. But obviously, the ones who need OT, are atypically developing. I sometimes forget what typical development looks like and probably get overly excited about typically-developing kids at this point. "Your 10-month-old is cruising, using furniture for stability! Amazing! Developmentally appropriate!" "In the picture of your 6-month-old you posted on Facebook, I can see that he's ring-sitting. Amazing! Developmentally appropriate!"

Occupational therapy has ruined my life, by taking away a lot of the blissful ignorance regarding how people develop due to interactions with each other and their environments and how efficiently (or not) they are able to continue interacting with people and environments. I don't look at anyone doing anything the same anymore ever.  But I wouldn't have it any other way.
