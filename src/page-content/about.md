# About Me
I graduated in December 2014 from the entry-level Master of Occupational Therapy program at the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences, in St. Augustine, Florida. I write because I love OT and have a lot of thoughts buzzing around that I want to share about my experiences in OT school, on Fieldwork, my first job as a new grad, which I started in January 2015, and the adventure of Travel Therapy, which began January 2018! My ideas and words are solely my own.

## About the blog's name:

In OT school, my cohort (the Red Class) had a saying: "There's OT for that." We'd say it to each other as a joke, most often when someone bumped into something or  knocked something over/off the desk. There's a lot that occupational therapists can do to address balance... and so much more! Tying your shoes? Getting dressed? Speaking in front of large groups? Finding the balance between work and play? There's OT for that!
